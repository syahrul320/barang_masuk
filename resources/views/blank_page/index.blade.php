        <h4>Where does it come from?</h4>
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
            classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a
            Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
            Latin words, consectetur.</p>
        <h4>Where can I get some?</h4>
        <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have
            suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look
            even slightly believable.</p>
        <p>If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything
            embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet
            tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the
            Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model
            sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.</p>
        <h4>Why do we use it?</h4>
        <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a
            page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a
            more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content
            here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page
            editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will
            uncover many web sites still in their infancy.</p>
